CHANGELOG
---------

### v3.6.1, 2020.11.07

- Fixed serialization error [#84](https://github.com/opis/closure/issues/84)

### v3.6.0, 2020.10.12

- Initial PHP 8 Support [#67](https://github.com/opis/closure/issues/67).

### v3.5.7, 2020.09.06

- Fixed issue [#76](https://github.com/opis/closure/issues/76).
- Fixed issue [#78](https://github.com/opis/closure/issues/78).

### v3.5.6, 2020.08.11

- Fixed issue [#70](https://github.com/opis/closure/issues/70)

### v3.5.5, 2020.06.17

- Fixed a false-positive when using `Opis\Closure\ReflectionClosure::isScopeRequired` method

### v3.5.4, 2020.06.07

- Fixed a false-positive when using `Opis\Closure\ReflectionClosure::isScopeRequired` method
- Fixed a bug related to `T_STRING_VARNAME`

### v3.5.3, 2020.05.25

- Improved parser
- The class scope optimisation is no longer used. We always bind now to the closure's original class scope.
When the class scope was `null`, the optimisation failed to work as expected and kept the wrong `SerializableClosure` scope.

### v3.5.2, 2020.05.21

- Removed extra semicolon in short closures, since is not part of the closure's body.

### v3.5.1, 2019.11.30

- Bugfix. See #47

### v3.5.0, 2019.11.29

- Added support for short closures (arrow functions)
- Added `isShortClosure` method to `Opis\Closure\ReflectionClosure`

### v3.4.2, 2019.11.29

- Added `stream_set_option()`

### v3.4.1, 2019.10.19

- Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/opis/closure/issues/40) that prevented serialization to work correctly.

### v3.4.0, 2019.09.03

- Added `createClosure` static method in `Opis\Closure\SerializableClosure`.
This method creates a new closure from arbitrary code, emulating `create_function`,
but without using eval

### v3.3.1, 2019.07.10

- Use `sha1` instead of `md5` for hashing file names in `Opis\Closure\ReflectionClosure` class

### v3.3.0, 2019.05.31

- Fixed a bug that prevented signed closures to properly work when the serialized string
contains invalid UTF-8 chars. Starting with this version `json_encode` is no longer used
when signing a closure. Backward compatibility is maintained and all closures that were 
previously signed using the old method will continue to work.

### v3.2.0, 2019.05.05

- Since an unsigned closure can be unserialized when no security provider is set, 
there is no reason to treat differently a signed closure in the same situation.
Therefore, the `Opis\Closure\SecurityException` exception  is no longer thrown when 
unserializing a signed closure, if no security provider is set.

### v3.1.6, 2019.02.22

- Fixed a bug that occurred when trying to set properties of classes that were not defined in user-land.
Those properties are now ignored.

### v3.1.5, 2019.01.14

- Improved parser

### v3.1.4, 2019.01.14

- Added support for static methods that are named using PHP keywords or magic constants.
Ex: `A::new()`, `A::use()`, `A::if()`, `A::function()`, `A::__DIR__()`, etc.
- Used `@internal` to mark classes & methods that are for internal use only and
backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

### v3.1.3, 2019.01.07

- Fixed a bug that prevented traits to be correctly resolved when used by an
anonymous class
- Fixed a bug that occurred when `$this` keyword was used inside an anonymous class
