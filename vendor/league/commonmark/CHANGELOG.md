## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [2.4.1] - 2023-08-30

### Fixed

- Fixed `ExternalLinkProcessor` not fully disabling the `rel` attribute when configured to do so (#992)

## [2.4.0] - 2023-03-24

### Added

- Added generic `CommonMarkException` marker interface for all exceptions thrown by the library
- Added several new specific exception types implementing that marker interface:
    - `AlreadyInitializedException`
    - `InvalidArgumentException`
    - `IOException`
    - `LogicException`
    - `MissingDependencyException`
    - `NoMatchingRendererException`
    - `ParserLogicException`
- Added more configuration options to the Heading Permalinks extension (#939):
    - `heading_permalink/apply_id_to_heading` - When `true`, the `id` attribute will be applied to the heading element itself instead of the `<a>` tag
    - `heading_permalink/heading_class` - class to apply to the heading element
    - `heading_permalink/insert` - now accepts `none` to prevent the creation of the `<a>` link
- Added new `table/alignment_attributes` configuration option to control how table cell alignment is rendered (#959)

### Changed

- Change several thrown exceptions from `RuntimeException` to `LogicException` (or something extending it), including:
    - `CallbackGenerator`s that fail to set a URL or return an expected value
    - `MarkdownParser` when deactivating the last block parser or attempting to get an active block parser when they've all been closed
    - Adding items to an already-initialized `Environment`
    - Rendering a `Node` when no renderer has been registered for it
- `HeadingPermalinkProcessor` now throws `InvalidConfigurationException` instead of `RuntimeException` when invalid config values are given.
- `HtmlElement::setAttribute()` no longer requires the second parameter for boolean attributes
- Several small micro-optimizations
- Changed Strikethrough to only allow 1 or 2 tildes per the updated GFM spec

### Fixed

- Fixed inaccurate `@throws` docblocks throughout the codebase, including `ConverterInterface`, `MarkdownConverter`, and `MarkdownConverterInterface`.
    - These previously suggested that only `\RuntimeException`s were thrown, which was inaccurate as `\LogicException`s were also possible.

 - **Moved and renamed several classes** - [see the full list here](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.0/upgrading/#classesnamespaces-renamed)
 - The `HeadingPermalinkExtension` and `FootnoteExtension` were modified to ensure they never produce a slug which conflicts with slugs created by the other extension
 - `SlugNormalizer::normalizer()` now supports optional prefixes and max length options passed in via the `$context` argument
 - The `AbstractBlock::$data` and `AbstractInline::$data` arrays were replaced with a `Data` array-like object on the base `Node` class
 - **Implemented a new approach to block parsing.** This was a massive change, so here are the highlights:
   - Functionality previously found in block parsers and node elements has moved to block parser factories and block parsers, respectively ([more details](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/2.0/upgrading/#new-block-parsing-approach))
   - `ConfigurableEnvironmentInterface::addBlockParser()` is now `EnvironmentBuilderInterface::addBlockParserFactory()`
   - `ReferenceParser` was re-implemented and works completely different than before
   - The paragraph parser no longer needs to be added manually to the environment
 - **Implemented a new approach to inline parsing** where parsers can now specify longer strings or regular expressions they want to parse (instead of just single characters):
   - `InlineParserInterface::getCharacters()` is now `getMatchDefinition()` and returns an instance of `InlineParserMatch`
   - `InlineParserContext::__construct()` now requires the contents to be provided as a `Cursor` instead of a `string`
 - **Implemented delimiter parsing as a special type of inline parser** (via the new `DelimiterParser` class)
 - **Changed block and inline rendering to use common methods and interfaces**
   - `BlockRendererInterface` and `InlineRendererInterface` were replaced by `NodeRendererInterface` with slightly different parameters. All core renderers now implement this interface.

   - `EnvironmentInterface::getBlockRenderersForClass()` and `getInlineRenderersForClass()` are now just `getRenderersForClass()`
 - **Completely refactored the Configuration implementation**
   - All configuration-specific classes have been moved into a new `league/config` package with a new namespace
   - `Configuration` objects must now be configured with a schema and all options must match that schema - arbitrary keys are no longer permitted
   - `Configuration::__construct()` no longer accepts the default configuration values - use `Configuration::merge()` instead

   - `ConfigurableEnvironmentInterface` was renamed to `EnvironmentBuilderInterface`
   - `ExtensionInterface::register()` now requires an `EnvironmentBuilderInterface` param instead of `ConfigurableEnvironmentInterface`
 - **Added missing return types to virtually every class and interface method**
 - Re-implemented the GFM Autolink extension using the new inline parser approach instead of document processors
   - `EmailAutolinkProcessor` is now `EmailAutolinkParser`
   - `UrlAutolinkProcessor` is now `UrlAutolinkParser`
 - `HtmlElement` can now properly handle array (i.e. `class`) and boolean (i.e. `checked`) attribute values
 - `HtmlElement` automatically flattens any attributes with array values into space-separated strings, removing duplicate entries
 - Combined separate classes/interfaces into one:
   - `DisallowedRawHtmlRenderer` replaces `DisallowedRawHtmlBlockRenderer` and `DisallowedRawHtmlInlineRenderer`
   - `NodeRendererInterface` replaces `BlockRendererInterface` and `InlineRendererInterface`
 - Renamed the following methods:
   - `Environment` and `ConfigurableEnvironmentInterface`:

     - `addReference()` is now `add()`
     - `getReference()` is now `get()`
     - `listReferences()` is now `getIterator()`
   - Various node (block/inline) classes:

   - `EnvironmentInterface::HTML_INPUT_STRIP` is now `HtmlFilter::STRIP`
   - `TableCell::TYPE_HEAD` is now `TableCell::TYPE_HEADER`
   - `TableCell::TYPE_BODY` is now `TableCell::TYPE_DATA`
 - Changed the visibility of the following properties:
   - `AttributesInline::$attributes` is now `private`
   - `AttributesInline::$block` is now `private`
   - `TableCell::$align` is now `private`
   - `TableCell::$type` is now `private`
   - `TableSection::$type` is now `private`

   - `Context::setContainer()`
   - `Context::setBlocksParsed()`
   - `AbstractStringContainer::setContent()`

 - `ArrayCollection` only supports integer keys
 - `HtmlElement` now implements `Stringable`
 - `Cursor::saveState()` and `Cursor::restoreState()` now use `CursorState` objects instead of arrays
 - `NodeWalker::next()` now enters, traverses any children, and leaves all elements which may have children (basically all blocks plus any inlines with children). Previously, it only did this for elements explicitly marked as "containers".
 - `InvalidOptionException` was removed
 - Anything with a `getReference(): ReferenceInterface` method now implements `ReferencableInterface`
 - The `SmartPunct` extension now replaces all unpaired `Quote` elements with `Text` elements towards the end of parsing, making the `QuoteRenderer` unnecessary

   - Footnote identifiers can no longer contain spaces
   - Anonymous footnotes can now span subsequent lines
   - Footnotes can now contain multiple lines of content, including sub-blocks, by indenting them
   - Footnote event listeners now have numbered priorities (but still execute in the same order)
   - Footnotes must now be separated from previous content by a blank line

 - `AnonymousFootnoteRefParser` and `HeadingPermalinkProcessor` now implement `EnvironmentAwareInterface` instead of `ConfigurationAwareInterface`
 - The second argument to `TextNormalizerInterface::normalize()` must now be an array
 - The `title` attribute for `Link` and `Image` nodes is now stored using a dedicated property instead of stashing it in `$data`
 - `ListData::$delimiter` now returns either `ListBlock::DELIM_PERIOD` or `ListBlock::DELIM_PAREN` instead of the literal delimiter

### Fixed
